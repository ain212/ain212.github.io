## Your First Data Science Project

### Due Date: 3 Jan 2025

In this project, you are expected to complete the lifecycle of Data Science for a specific dataset that you choose. 

This year's theme is **Environmental Data**, so you should work on a dataset that is closely related to this theme. The dataset you choose should be suitable for classification task. 

More specifically, your project should consist of the following steps:
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Data Exploration
- Feature Engineering
- Predictive Modelling
- Data Visualization

## Step 1: Data Collection
In this step, you can either use one of the existing datasets or scrap the web for collecting your own data. Make sure that the data you have consists of at least 5000 data points with 12 features at minimum. 

At this step, you can use many of the existing dataset resources to acquire your data, some of which are listed below. **Note that you can take a proper subset of an larger dataset if you need to.** 

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning 
Based on the data science question that you want to explore, preprocess the data according to the principles that we have discussed in class. You may need to do cleaning, if the data has significant amount of noise. Also, you may need to preprocess the textual data to create your own variables. Describe in detail all the data preprocessing steps that you have done. Analyze your data and report your observations. 

## Step 3: Data Exploration and Analysis
In this step, you should explore data, present some of the critical statistics about the data that has been collected and preprocessed. At this step, you should also carry out **clustering** analysis on the data as well. The results of data analysis step must be presented via visualization and the results of clustering should be discussed in detail. 

## Step 4: Predictive Modelling
In this step, you should carry on **classification** based on what you want to predict from the data. You should apply at least **three classification algorithms** that we have talked about in class and compare their performance. You should clearly state which algorithms that you try and why. You should properly setup your training environment, ie. setup your training, validation and test sets. You should also comment on the parameter selection procedures and analyse the performance based on the parameters. 

## Step 5: Model Evaluation and Visualizations  
In this last step of the data science cycle, you should evaluate your classification model based on various different evaluation metrics. In addition, you should provide visualizations on the performance of your algorithm (such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, PR curves, etc.).

You should present all your findings in a report.
